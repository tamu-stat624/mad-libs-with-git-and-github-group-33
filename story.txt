Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Shiv,

I am writing to you from a intergalactic spaceship in a alienated galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a Magenta rocket in October. There are 8735378765 lions and tigers of pink here! In the
A101 there is a pool full of blood. I fall asleep each night on a comfortable bed of
mushrooms and dream of reading murder mysteries. It feels as though I have lived here for
9 days. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
flying on a sleek spaceship!!

Best wishes,
Robert
